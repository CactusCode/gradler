Make [gradle](https://gradle.org/) usage easier.

## Gradler
1. Run `./init` (This will add a symlink to the `gradler` script).
2. Be in a folder with a `gradlew` file.
3. Run `gradler` without any arguments. The script will by itself show instructions on its usage.

## Planned improvements
* ~Add default variables~
* ~Add gradler update notification system~
* Improve update system to wait some time before rechecking version
* Make sure a single "cmd + c" kills the whole script
